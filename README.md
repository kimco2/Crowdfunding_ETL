# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Hello, this is the repository for Project 2 - Crowdfunding ETL

### In here you will find:

 - '**ETL_Mini_Project_KColeman.ipynb**' - contains the code and output for the project.

 - In the folder called '**Resources**' you will find:
    - Four csv files
        1. category.csv
        2. subcategory.csv
        3. campaign.csv
        4. contacts.csv
    - Two xlsx files which were provided in the project files (called 'contacts.xlsx' and 'crowdfunding.xlsx') 

- In the folder called '**Crowdfunding_database**' you will find:
    - **crowdfunding_erd** - the entity relationship diagram
    - **crowdfunding_db_schema** - the code used to create the tables, verify table creation, import the relevant csv files, and verify each table has the correct data. 
    - The folder called **ouput** contains the exported data from the crowdfunding_db_schema.
   
Thanks
