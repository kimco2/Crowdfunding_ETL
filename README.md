# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Hello, this is the repository for Project 2 - Crowdfunding ETL

### In here you will find:

 - '**ETL_Mini_Project_KColeman.ipynb**' - contains the code for setting up the csv files for the project.
 - **crowdfunding_erd** - is the entity relationship diagram.
 - '**crowdfunding_db_schema.ipynb**' - the code used to create the tables, verify table creation, import the relevant csv files, and verify each table has the correct data. 
 - In the folder called '**Resources**' you will find the four created csv files:
        
            1. category.csv
            2. subcategory.csv
            3. campaign.csv
            4. contacts.csv
     - As well as two xlsx files (called 'contacts.xlsx' and 'crowdfunding.xlsx'), which were provided in the project files 

- In the folder called '**Crowdfunding_database_output**' I have saved the exported data from sql, once the data had been imported.
   
Thanks

Kim
